# Sainne's Expert Overhaul ðŸ˜ˆ
Making the game harder by locking items and upgrades behind challenges, mini-bosses and new enemies, and mechanics that punish sedentary and overly-safe behaviour.
## Features
### New mechanics ðŸ©¸
- Receiving lethal damage(>6hp) gives you blindness and slowness.(The effects are worse for over 14hp and 18hp)
- **No regeneration trough saturation**, instead you can regenerate at a campfire, sleeping, or very slowly with full hunger.
- Sleeping leaves you hungry and slowed for 2 minutes.
- Phantoms do not spawn with insomnia, instead they appear at high altitudes and in specific biomes(in the End)
- Now a majority of villages are **abandoned** villages, filled with zombies and a lack of society.
### Items have been nerfed ðŸ”¨
- Elytra now damages the user when in water(rain or source).
- Elytra now is **flammable** setting the user on fire in the nether.
- Elytra now uses more durability at high altitudes y>320
- Iron armor makes you 4% slower.
- Diamond armor makes you 8% slower.
- Netherite armor makes you 12% slower.
### Changed Recipes ðŸ’€
<details>
  <summary>See changed recipes</summary>

  - Shields are more expensive to craft(8 iron ingots, and 1 plank).(overhaul pending)

  ![Ender Crystal crafting][endercrystalimage]
  - Anvils are more complicated to obtain now, since they require a netherite ingot to craft
  ![Anvil crafting][anvilimage]
  - Enchanting tables are harder to obtain as well, since they require an enchanted book in their crafting.

## Credits and inspiration âœ¨
The main reason for this datapack is the video on the difficulty of minecraft from "[JustCornet](https://www.youtube.com/@JustCornet)"(Is in spanish):

[MINECRAFT y su DIFICULTAD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtCZl-_GAq0)

The map "Final Paradox" and more specifically the zone "Serpent's Corpse" is an inspiration for the regeneration overhaul:

[Final Paradox on the Minecraft Forum](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/maps/3166897-ctm-final-paradox-map-release-english-espanol-1)

The Permadeath series done by ElRichMC is an inspiration for the progressive difficulty as well as some of the mobs and enemies.

[First episode of Permadeath on ElRichMC's channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZSX5ik0Z6o)

The expert mode coming from Terraria and the Revengeance mode from the Calamity mod also inspire the progressive difficulty and some of the items.

And lastly my own experience!, in playing UHC and Hardcore worlds, and seeing mechanics that are more dominant than others in PvE.

### Planned ðŸ§ 
<details>
  <summary>CLICK</summary>

  - Netherite ingot/upgrade behind mini-boss of the nether.
  - Elytra behind mini-boss of the end
  - Shulker changed to be way more dangerous
  - Upon obtaining iron armor, zombies can have a dashing variant
  ###### Special weather
  - Acid rain (receive constant wither damage while under rain)
  - Windy (New mobs spawn related to phantoms)
  - Blood Moon (New mobs spawn related to mutated mobs)
  - Eclipse (New mobs spawn related to spookier mobs)
  ###### Progressive difficulty behind advancements ðŸ”’
Mobs get harder with each advancement accomplished from the datapack, it still keeps the openess of the base game by making these advancements non linear, as such the player has option of what to unlock when progressing.
