# Sainne's Expert Overhaul ðŸ‘¿
Changing the game's progression by locking items and upgrades behind challenges, mini-bosses and new enemies.
## Features
### New mechanics ðŸ©¸
- Receiving lethal damage(>6hp) gives you blindness and slowness.(The effects are higher for over 12hp and 16hp)
- No regeneration trough food, instead you can regenerate at a campfire, sleeping, or very slowly with full hunger.
- Sleeping leaves you hungry and slowed for 1 minute.
- Now a majority of villages are zombified villages.
### Items have been nerfed ðŸ”¨
- Elytra now is toxic to water(rain or source).
- Elytra now is flammable setting the user on fire.
- Iron armor makes you 4% slower.
- Diamond armor makes you 8% slower.
- Netherite armor practically makes you 12% slower.
- Shields are more expensive to craft(8 iron ingots, and 1 plank).(overhaul pending)
- Ender Crystals are now harder to obtain, requiring a nether star instead of a ghast tear in their crafting.
- Anvils are more complicated to obtain now, since they require a netherite ingot to craft
- Enchanting tables are harder to obtain as well, since they require an enchanted book in their crafting.
- Brewing stands are harder to obtain requiring gilded blackstone instead of cobblestone in their recipe.
## Credits and inspiration âœ¨
The main reason for this datapack is the video on the difficulty of minecraft from "[JustCornet](https://www.youtube.com/@JustCornet)"(Is in spanish):
[MINECRAFT y su DIFICULTAD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtCZl-_GAq0)
The map "Final Paradox" and more specifically the zone "Serpent's Corpse" is an inspiration for the regeneration overhaul:

The Permadeath series done by ElRichMC is an inspiration for the progressive difficulty as well as some of the mobs and enemies.
[First episode of Permadeath on ElRichMC's channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZSX5ik0Z6o)
The expert mode coming from Terraria and the Revengeance mode from the Calamity mod also inspire the progressive difficulty and some of the items.
